     knows how many messages are queued across all of its actors. This is what
     scheduler_pool_wait_for_idle waits on (in addition to all workers being
     idle) so it never returns with an undelivered message still stranded in a

     message_queue_destroy so the DESTROY-check-then-push TOCTOU in
     actor_send cannot fire. The single worker that pops/markempty's is
     not affected (it runs after destroy has waited for the worker via
     actor_destroy's RUNNING spin). See docs/concurrency-pass.md F4.

     `send_lock` is an embedded spinlock (0 = unlocked, 1 = locked) rather
     than a heap-allocated platform_mutex_t: a late sender (timer pd-loop
     thread, MsQuic callback) may arrive AFTER message_queue_destroy has
     returned and the containing actor struct may already have been freed
     by the caller. With a heap mutex we would have to either (a) keep the
     mutex alive forever (a per-actor leak that breaks valgrind) or (b)
     destroy it in message_queue_destroy, which makes any late send that
     races past the destroyed check dereference a freed/NULL mutex. The
     spinlock is embedded in the queue struct, so its lifetime is the
     struct's lifetime — no separate allocation, no destruction, no leak,
     and a late send that takes it observes `destroyed` and frees its
     message without UB. It uses ATOMIC(uint8_t) (not _Atomic bool) for
     cross-platform C/C++ compatibility via the atomic_compat.h macros.

     `destroyed` is a plain bool: it is only read/written while holding
     send_lock, so the spinlock provides all the synchronization needed. */
