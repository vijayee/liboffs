     this is cheap and safe. Don't gate on ACTOR_FLAG_PRESSURED: the first

     (a public API that sets PRESSURED without mailbox overflow) wouldn't

       Skipped for self-destruction: the worker holds queue_state = RUNNING
       on this stack and would deadlock waiting for itself; actor_run's
       post-dispatch DESTROY check sets IDLE before returning, but the
       self-destroy path bypasses message_queue_destroy entirely (the
