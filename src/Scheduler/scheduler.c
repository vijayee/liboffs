/* Recovery scan for stranded actors. Called by scheduler_pool_wait_for_idle
   when every worker is idle yet pending_messages is non-zero — the symptom of
   the elusive work-stealing strand, where a message was pushed to an actor's
   mailbox but the actor is in no worker's deque/inject queue and is not
   running (so no worker will ever pick it up on its own). Re-injecting such an
   actor wakes a worker to drain its mailbox, restoring forward progress.

   The race itself is emergent from the inject/idle/steal interaction and is
   not pinned to a single structure; this scan makes wait_for_idle correct
   regardless of how a message strands, which is the property callers actually
   depend on (every queued message is dispatched before wait_for_idle returns).

   A strand can also be a lost wakeup: an actor whose SCHEDULED flag is set but
   which is in no worker's deque and not in the inject queue (the schedule+inject
   raced with the idle machinery and was lost). Such a stale-SCHEDULED actor is
   re-injected too — when every worker is idle, a SCHEDULED flag can only be
   stale, because a genuinely-scheduled actor would occupy a worker's deque or
   the inject queue and that worker would not be idle. Re-injecting cannot
   double-run it: no worker holds it when all are idle.

   Only DESTROY-flagged actors are skipped: their owner is tearing them down
   and will drain the mailbox itself via message_queue_destroy (which decrements
   pending_messages), so re-injecting would race with that teardown.

   registry_lock is held throughout, including across scheduler_inject. No
   other path acquires registry_lock while holding inject.lock (actor_send and
   backpressure_release take inject.lock without registry_lock; actor_destroy
   takes them sequentially — backpressure_release releases inject.lock before
   actor_detach_pool takes registry_lock), so this nested registry->inject order
   is deadlock-free. Holding the lock for the whole scan also means a concurrent
   actor_destroy / actor_detach_pool (both take registry_lock) cannot free an
   actor mid-scan, so the scan never dereferences freed memory. Returns true if
   any actor was re-injected, false if none was re-injectable (meaning the
   remaining pending messages live only in DESTROY actors whose owner will
   drain them). */
